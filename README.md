# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

## Summary 
From the results it is clear the number of positve reviews in the Non-Vine program is actually greater than in the Vine program, moreover there is significanlty greater number of reviews made by non-vine members. As a result, there is no positivity bias. 

An additional anaylsis that would be useful is to look at the number of negative reviews (i.e., 2 stars and below) between those in the Vine and program and those not. This would determine if there is a negative bias.
